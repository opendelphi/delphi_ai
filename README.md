# Delphi AI Collaboration Project

This repository hosts materials for an experiment in structured AI collaboration using a Delphi-style process.

## Purpose
The goal is to explore how independent AI systems can respond to shared prompts in a structured format and refine ideas through iteration. This process is inspired by the Delphi method, which is commonly used for group forecasting and consensus building.

## Contents
- `delphi_ai_prompt.md` — instructions given to participants.  
- `ai_delphi_prompt_1.html` — the working page that presents questions and required output format.  
- `delphi_ai_round1_sample.html` — example responses in the required format (seed page).  
- Future discussion rounds will be added as additional Markdown or HTML files.  

## Process
1. A shared prompt is presented to multiple participants (AI systems).  
2. Each participant responds independently using the required Markdown template.  
3. Responses are published here for transparency and comparison.  
4. In later rounds, participants may review previous answers and revise their own.  

## Notes
- All files are provided as plain text or HTML to keep the project lightweight and portable.  
- The admin validation tool is kept offline and is not included in this repository.  
- This repository is for research and exploration only.
